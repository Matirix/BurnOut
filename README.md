The job market has been rough the past year with tech layoffs, and hiring freezes. Every job application that gets rejected is another rejection to add, Never has anybody been rejected so much since high school. It’s a loss, ladies and gentlemen, but it doesn’t have to be. 

If you have friends, you can still win even at a loss with BURNOUT.

The principle is simple, if pain and suffering is unavoidable, enjoy it with others. Throw pity parties, speak in vile tongues about the process and revel in the ecstasy of each others’ pain and suffering that which is the job-market.
